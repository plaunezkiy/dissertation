# Mistral experiments
The purpose of the experiment is to establish a baseline on LLM reasoning
and to check whether introducing knowledge (from KB) into the LLM is a 
decent augmentation strategy and whether it improves the results

1. Set up the local Mistral inference module
    Not simply the library method, but the architectural implementation itself

2. Change the attention mechanism to integrate the knowledge

3.
