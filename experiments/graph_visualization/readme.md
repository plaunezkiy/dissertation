# Graph visualization

Freebase QA comes with a inferential chain that shows how the answer can be obtained

The point of this experiment is to:
- build a visual
- Display the correct chain (highlight the **correct** nodes in **green**)
- Highlight in **size** the chosen nodes
- have a chat window to display the query and the LLM response
