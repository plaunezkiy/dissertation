However, since the context includes Harvard University, Dartmouth College, and Columbia University as institutions where government majors have graduated, it is possible that one of their alumni influenced Whitman. To provide an answer, I assumed that the question meant who among the graduates of these institutions influenced Whitman, and I chose Walt Whitman himself, as he was a student at Brook Farm, which was associated with Harvard University, and he also studied law at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, which was associated with Columbia University.)"
