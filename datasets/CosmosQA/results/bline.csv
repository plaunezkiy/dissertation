"A (Because they are level 6 at the moment) is not a plausible reason for not having the expansion pack, as level in a game doesn't typically determine whether or not a player has an expansion pack.

B (Because they had most head shots in a game) is also not a plausible reason, as having a high score or achievement in a game doesn't necessarily mean they would receive an expansion pack.

C (Because they had an eagle icon) is a possible reason, but it's not explicitly stated in the context that the eagle icon is part of the expansion pack. However, it's reasonable to assume that the eagle icon could be a reward from an expansion pack.

D (Because they did n't want to spend money on it) is not mentioned in the context, so it cannot be confirmed as the most plausible answer.

Given the information provided, the most plausible answer would be C (Because they had an eagle icon), as it's reasonable to assume that the eagle icon could be a reward from an expansion pack. However, without more context, this answer is not definitive."
