Context:

* In the film 'High Noon', Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is a marshal who is about to retire and leave town with his new bride, Amy (Grace Kelly).
* However, he learns that a group of outlaws, led by Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), are coming to town on the noon train to kill him because he put them in prison.
* Kane tries to get help from the townspeople, but most of them are afraid to help him and turn their backs on him.
* One of the few people who does offer to help Kane is his old friend, Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges), who was once the deputy marshal but was fired by Kane for being corrupt.
* Pell offers to help Kane, but it is later revealed that he has also sworn to kill Kane and is only pretending to help him in order to get close to him and kill him.
* The other person who has sworn to kill Kane is Hannigan (Karl Malden), who is the leader of the outlaw gang that is coming to town to kill Kane.
* In the end, Kane is able to outsmart Hannigan and the outlaws and survive the attack, but he is left feeling betrayed and alone as most of the townspeople refused to help him."

(Note: This response is based on the context provided, which does not explicitly mention the phrase ""passed into language,"" but the character Walter Mitty is well-known for being a daydreamer and the phrase ""daydreaming fantasist"" is a fitting description of him. The phrase ""passed into language"" is generally used to refer to words, phrases, or expressions that have become widely used or recognized in a language, but in this case, it can be inferred that the character Walter Mitty has become a widely recognized and well-known figure, much like a common phrase or expression.)"

However, it's important to note that the length of a play can be subjective and depends on various factors such as the number of acts, scenes, and lines. In terms of running time, the longest Shakespeare play on stage is often ""Hamlet"" due to its many speeches and complex plot. But if we're talking about the longest play in terms of the number of lines, it's ""Hamlet"" again, but ""Henry IV, Part 1"" comes very close."
