In case you'd like to know more about Francis Drake and his famous voyage, here's a brief summary:

Francis Drake was an English sea captain, privateer, navigator, and politician of the Elizabethan era. In 1577, he set sail on a circumnavigation of the globe, commanding the ship called the Golden Hind. This journey, which lasted until 1580, made Drake the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe and the second person (after Magellan) to complete a successful circumnavigation. The voyage was fraught with danger, including battles with Spanish ships, encounters with indigenous peoples, and harsh conditions at sea. Despite these challenges, Drake and his crew successfully completed the journey, returning to England as heroes. The Golden Hind, a galleon, was a small but sturdy ship that proved well-suited to the demands of long-distance exploration and navigation."
