(The correct answer is Disraeli, Disraeli as Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, was a British statesman and Liberal politician who served as Prime Minister from 1855 to 1858 and again from 1859 to 1865, while Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield, was a British statesman and Conservative politician who served as Prime Minister from 1868 to 1874 and again from 1874 to 1880. The question asks for the name by which Henry John Temple was better known, and he was more commonly known as Lord Palmerston, not Disraeli.)"

* Trotsky was a prominent figure in the Russian Revolution and the Russian Civil War, and later founded the Fourth International.
* Mercader was motivated by his support for Stalin and his opposition to Trotsky's political views.
* Trotsky was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929 and lived in Mexico until his death.
* Mercader was arrested and sentenced to 20 years in prison for the murder, but was released after serving only 19 years.
* Trotsky's death marked the end of the revolutionary era of the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalin's totalitarian regime."
