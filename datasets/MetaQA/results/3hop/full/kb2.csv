"Guillermo del Toro wrote films such as ""Catch and Release"" (2006), ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), and ""The Orphanage"" (2007) which were released in different years than Pan's Labyrinth (2006). However, the question asks for films with the same screenwriter as Pan's Labyrinth, and the only other film mentioned in the context is ""Paprika"" (2006), which was also written by Guillermo del Toro. So, the answer is 2006 (for ""Paprika"")."

"Francis Ford Coppola, one of the directors of Captain EO, directed movies such as The Outsiders (1983), Jack (1996), Supernova (2000), and many others. However, the question asks for movies that released in 1986, and there is no information in the context about any movies directed by Coppola that were released in 1986. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the question based on the given context."
