"Depends on the specific orchestra, but it's often conducted in German.

Explanation:

In orchestral settings, conductors often use German terms for various musical directions, such as ""Allegro"" (fast), ""Andante"" (walking tempo), ""Adagio"" (slowly), ""Presto"" (very fast), etc. However, it's important to note that orchestras can also use other languages, such as French, Italian, or English, depending on the conductor's preference or the piece being performed."
